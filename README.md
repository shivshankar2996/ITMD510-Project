# Management Platform for Hotel-Motel Bookings


The hotel business has seen an increase in competition as a result of the quick economic and
tourism growth. They can achieve sufficient, healthy growth if they continually enhance their
management strategies and procedures as well as the caliber of their output. Therefore, the
operation of the online hotel reservation management system has become very important.

Hotel Management System is meant to create an End -to -End system for the customer to book
rooms in the hotel and have a smooth transaction through the entire booking procedure. The
hotel management system keeps track of all the guests and offers tools for booking, registering,
checking room rates, etc. Manual methods have drawbacks, such as limited data storage
capacity and slow processing speed.

In this app the customers can register themselves, login into their account, check room
availability and book a room. The customer can also update their details and logout once they
are done. The admin can register himself, login and manage the availability of rooms and delete
the room information. Manager can login and grant admin access to the admin and can view
the list of bookings.
